# Memory-game

Welcome to my Javascript memory game!

Turn over the cards, selecting matching pairs to win the game.

It was created using HTML, SCSS and Javascript.

Here are my aims for the game:

//1. cards will be shuffled when game reloads
//2. game will react correctly to matched or unmatched cards
//3. game will show number of moves the player makes
//4. a timer will start when game begins and stop when game ends
//5. reset button will restart the game and timer
